In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

In computing, binary trees are used in two very different ways:
First, as a means of accessing nodes based on some value or label associated with each node. Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement __binary search trees__ and __binary heaps__, and are used for efficient **searching and sorting**.

Second, as a representation of data with a relevant bifurcating structure. In such cases, the particular arrangement of nodes under and/or to the left or right of other nodes is part of the information (that is, changing it would change the meaning).
